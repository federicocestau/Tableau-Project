Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so the task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

By what percentage has total ridership grown?

How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

How does the average trip duration change by age?

Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

City officials would also like to see one of the following visualizations:

A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.
